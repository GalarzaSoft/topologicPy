## About

This module integrates a set of Python bindings for the Topologic module.

## Testing

Topologic bindings were tested on Ubuntu and Windows. 

To get started with the module you will need to:

1. Build cpython Python module
2. Run example.py

## Build module

You can use the Python setup scripts to build the module locally.

To build the module:

1. cd into ./cpython/
```
cd ./cpython/
```
2. Run build
```
python setup.py build
```
2. Run install
```
python setup.py install
```

## Run example

There is an example test file we have used to test the module. This example, while basic, shows how you can
use the Python/C++ to make calls directly to Topologic.

```
python ./cpython/example.py
```

Example output
```
